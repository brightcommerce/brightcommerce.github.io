					What?
				</h3>
				<p class="mg-lg ">
					Brightcommerce fosters new technology and innovation that aims to compete with traditional financial methods in the delivery of financial services. <br> <br>Brightcommerce builds software solutions using technologies such as blockchain, cryptography, artificial intelligence, peer-to-peer and automated workflow.
				</p>
				<h3 class="mg-md">
					Why?
				</h3>
				<p class="mg-lg ">
					Global investment in financial technology increased more than twelvefold from $930 million in 2008 to more than $12 billion in 2014. <br> <br>Finance is seen as one of the industries most vulnerable to disruption by software because financial services, much like publishing, are made of information rather than concrete goods. In particular blockchains have the potential to reduce the cost of transacting in a financial system.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-6">
				<h3 class="mg-md">
					How?
				</h3>
				<p class="mg-lg ">
					Brightcommerce assesses the most appropriate tools to build the solution for the problem at hand. This means our toolchain usually changes for each project. <br> <br>Our team are experts with many years of software development and operational skills in scoping, developing, testing and after-sales support.
				</p>
				<h3 class="mg-md">
					Where?
				</h3>
				<p class="mg-lg ">
					Founded in 2012, Brightcommerce, Inc. is a Delaware USA corporation but operates globally building solutions for a diverse array of clients. <br> <br>We have a number of our own projects in the pipeline also and our target markets include USA, EU and Australasian regions.

This copyright notice applies to everyone, including all visitors to this website.</p>
<h4>DMCA Provisions</h4>
<p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, found at 17 U.S.C. Section 512 ("DMCA"), provides recourse for owners of copyrighted materials who believe that their rights under United States copyright law have been infringed upon on the Internet.</p>
<p>Under the DMCA, the bona fide owner of copyrighted materials who has a good faith belief that their copyright has been infringed may contact not only the person or entity infringing on their copyright, but may also contact the designated agent of an Internet service provider to report alleged infringements of their protected works, when such alleged infringements appear on pages contained within the system of the Internet service provider ("ISP").</p>
<p>The owner of this website and the ISP are committed to complying with international trade law, international trade practices, all United States laws, including United States copyright law. Upon receipt of a properly filed complaint under the DMCA, the owner and/or the ISP of this website will block access to the allegedly infringing material. The website owner and/or the ISP will forward a copy of the notification of claimed copyright infringement to the alleged infringer. Anyone who believes in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has wrongfully been filed against them, may submit a Counter notice to the website owner and/or the ISP.</p>
<h4>Notification of Claimed Copyright Infringement</h4>
<p>Please send DMCA notifications of claimed copyright infringement to:</p>
<p>Copyright Agent<br/>Brightcommerce, Inc.<br/>16192 Coastal Highway<br/>Lewes, DE 19958<br/>United States of America</p>
<p>To file a notice of infringement with either the website owner or the ISP, you must provide a written communication that sets forth the items specified below. You will be liable for damages (including damages, costs, and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the website or a web page is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether certain material of yours is protected by copyright laws, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.</p>
<p>To expedite our ability to process your request, please use the following format (including section numbers):
<ul>
<li>Identify in sufficient detail the copyrighted work that you believe has been infringed upon.</li>
<li>Identify the material that you claim is infringing the copyrighted work listed in item #1 above. (You must include the URL(s) (the location(s) of the page(s) that contains the allegedly infringing material and also include a description of the specific content which you claim is infringing on your copyright.)</li>
<li>Provide information reasonably sufficient to permit the website owner to contact you (e-mail address and a phone number are required at a minimum).</li>
<li>Include the following statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. I also affirm that as the copyright owner, I have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by me, my agent, or the law."</li>
<li>The signature of the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner. You may send your notice via email provided such notice includes a proper electronic signature. The signature or electronic signature must be that of the copyright owner, or a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive copyright that has allegedly been infringed.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>For details on the information required for valid notification, see 17 U.S.C. Section 512(c)(3).</p>
<h4>Counternotification to Claimed Copyright Infringement</h4>
<p>If a notice of copyright infringement has been filed with the website owner and/or the ISP against you, the owner and/or the ISP will attempt to notify you and provide you with a copy of the notice of copyright infringement. If you have a good faith belief that you have been wrongfully accused, you may file a counter notification with the website owner and/or the ISP. If website owner and/or the ISP receive a valid counter notification, the DMCA provides that the removed or blocked information will be restored or access re-enabled.</p>
<p>The website owner and/or the ISP will replace the removed material and cease disabling access to it in not less than 10, nor more than 14, business days following receipt of the counter notification, unless the website owner and/or ISP first receives notice from the complaining party that such complaining party has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the alleged infringer from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on this website.</p>
<p>Please be advised that United States copyright law provides substantial penalties for a false counter notice filed in response to a notice of copyright infringement. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether certain material of yours is protected by copyright laws, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.</p>
